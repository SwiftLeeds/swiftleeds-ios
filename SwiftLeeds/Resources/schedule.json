This talk will provide a state of the union for Swift on the server and definitively prove that yes, we are there and it is being used in the real world for a wide range of backends from the very small to the absolutely massive.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the changes over the last year or two with Swift 6, structured concurrency, new generations of frameworks from Hummingbird and Vapor and an invigorated ecosystem that covers everything you'd ever need. We'll also look at Swift's general expansion into non-Apple platform areas covering everything from running in the browser with Swift Wasm and running on tidy embedded devices.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk you should have a good understanding of where Swift on the server is and how much it really is being used in the real world. You'll see _why_ it is becoming so popular and how it is setting itself apart from not only the traditional backend languages but newer languages as well.",

Although some of them are experimental or very specific to the compiler and the toolchain, quite a few could come in handy for any Swift developer.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore some of these open-source packages and see how we can put them to good use in our everyday code:\r\n- Swift Numerics makes your life easier when you need to implement more advanced mathematics. Its modular approach makes it useful even if you only need a small part, like handling complex numbers.\r\n- Swift Argument Parser simplifies the creation of command-line tools by taking care of argument parsing for you.\r\n- Subprocess makes it easy to spawn external processes and interface with their input and output, not only on macOS but also on Linux and Windows.\r\n- Swift Protobuf provides a nice alternative to Codable for data storage or messaging with other systems.\r\n- Swift Markdown comes in handy when manipulating Markdown documents.\r\n- Swift OpenAPI Generator is useful not only when you're doing server-side development but anytime you need to call a REST API from your Swift code.\r\n- swift-certificates takes care of the nitty-gritty details of dealing with X.509 certificates.\r\n\r\nWe'll also take a brief look at packages targeted at specific environments, like Swift MMIO, which simplifies bare-metal embedded development and the Swift Container Plugin, which makes creating Docker images much easier.\r\n\r\nThis talk targets any developer with a basic knowledge of Swift. We will not go into the details of how to use each package but show practical use cases where such packages can be valuable.\r\n\r\nAttendees will discover how, exploring the additional packages made available by Apple, can help in their day-to-day development tasks. But since these packages are open source, we encourage everyone to explore their implementation, or even better, contribute. This is a great way to learn even more and take your Swift expertise to the next level.",

Pretty much everyone has worked with it, it‚Äôs used literally in every app, yet not many developers interact with it‚Äôs API directly. \r\nBecause the Keychain's API, while being flexible, is often considered low-level, developers often use third-party libraries or wrappers to bridge the gap and present it's API in a simpler way. As a result, most developers become unaware of the full potential of the framework and might be reluctant to implement custom data storage and retrieval mechanisms associated with it.\r\nThis talk will shine the light on the intricacies of the Keychain by building one of those ‚ÄûKeychain Wrappers‚Äú from scratch and gradually adding support for extra functionality, such as the biometric authentication, sharing data across multiple apps and storing multiple data types.\r\nLater, we‚Äôll focus on creating custom authentication flows to improve user experience, for example, by not showing a biometric authentication prompt every time the user would like to access the data. \r\n\r\nThe following topics will be covered in detail:\r\n- Deep Dive into Keychain API: Understanding the API's structure, storage mechanics, and how it handles background encryption and decryption.\r\n\r\n- Enhanced Security through Biometrics: Strategies for integrating Face ID and Touch ID to protect data stored in the Keychain, and managing biometric state changes.\r\n\r\n- Efficient Data Management and Retrieval: Techniques for setting, retrieving, and  deleting data within Keychain, including error handling and best practices.\r\n\r\n- Cross-App / App Extensions Keychain Sharing: Implementing keychain groups to enable secure data sharing across multiple apps and managing access control for inter-app communication.\r\n\r\n- Security Analysis: Keychain-related coding tips for improving app security.

My goal with this talk is to lift much of the fear around time zones and help you avoid many of the mistakes I made.\r\n\r\nFor the first part of my talk, I want to show how easy it is to get yourself into trouble with time zones with subtle coding mistakes with multiple examples (adding to dates, displaying dates, formatting dates, dates in chart axis labels, etc).  I‚Äôll then explain how I slowly started to realize that things had gone off the rails with the time data my app was displaying.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm going to show multiple comments people have posted online about hating dealing with time zones or being outright afraid to. Some of these will be funny of course.\r\n\r\nThen I‚Äôll step through each of my code examples explaining why they were wrong and how to fix them.\r\n\r\nNow that we have a better understanding of how to code for time zones I want to explain how you should assume nothing about time zones or your data and give some examples.\r\n\r\nFor example, you might assume that Apple WeatherKit won‚Äôt tell you that a day starts at two different times in a single response. That assumption is incorrect and it absolutely can happen in certain locations thanks to time zone wackiness.\r\n\r\nThis is an unpleasant subject but I aim to make it a lighthearted talk that can hopefully help some people avoid what I went through and give them the confidence to tackle time zone coding.",

After years of debugging apps at scale, I‚Äôve built a toolkit of techniques, tools, and processes to help you quickly identify and fix those elusive performance problems like a pro.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I‚Äôll take you on a deep dive into analyzing real-world performance, memory, and UI issues using Xcode‚Äôs Instruments. Drawing from my own experience working with apps at scale, I‚Äôll walk you through the most common challenges developers face‚Äîfrom unexpected memory spikes to sluggish UI elements. You‚Äôll see how to approach these problems in practice, using real scenarios I‚Äôve encountered in production apps.\r\n\r\nWe‚Äôll explore several powerful Instruments templates, including Time Profiler for spotting CPU bottlenecks and analyzing thread usage, Zombies for catching memory leaks, and the Concurrency instrument for visualizing task execution and actor behavior. I‚Äôll also highlight the often-overlooked SwiftUI instrument‚Äîa potential game-changer for anyone working with SwiftUI.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you‚Äôll walk away with a clear process and a practical toolkit for investigating and resolving a wide range of app performance issues‚Äîready to put to work in your own projects.",

When users made a choice on one screen, that context needed to persist and influence logging on all subsequent screens. Rather than rely on brittle state passing, we modeled the logger itself as a structured, stateful component.\r\n\r\nThis approach separates logging concerns from UI, reduces boilerplate, and opens the door to broader uses: A/B testing, recommendation engines, and more.\r\nBy the end of the session, you‚Äôll see how even side effects can be designed ‚Äî and why that makes your architecture better.",
